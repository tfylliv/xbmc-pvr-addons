* Signal strength/BNR = 0. Why?

* Channel names are sometimes strange, where does that come from?

* Pick any tuner, don't need to run through them all?

* Get rid of static buffer?

* SwitchChannel() don't need to open/close, but actually isn't called, why?

* Add some configuration options?

* Channelscan dialog.
  * Deadlock in Frodo 12.0 (https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/pull/2188)

* Buffer full => readtotal busted/negative => crash.

* Delete scanner in destructor so we don't crash if existing while in the
  scanner dialog?
